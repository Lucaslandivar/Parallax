<h2>Description of the project</h2>
<p>I did a project to improve the aesthetic part of a website by implementing JavaScript.The aesthetic part of a website is for me as important as the functionality of it, with this project I was able to make a simple but dynamic and very beautiful site mainly.
My goal with this project was to learn some more JavaScript and CSS functionality to implement in future projects. I really like to take advantage of the knowledge acquired previously, I aim for my next project to use all my knowledge acquired in JavaScript and CSS to make a better project aesthetically and more dynamic.
